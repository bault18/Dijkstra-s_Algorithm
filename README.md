This project contains my code for Dijkstra's Algorithm.

Things to note:
-The input file should be formatted as follows
    # of nodes (space) # of edges
    starting node (space) ending node (space) distance between the two
    ...
    ...
    ...
    do that for all edges
    
-designate the starting and ending nodes near the top of the code
-project assumes undirected edges
  *to make directed remove the line of code "matrix[to][from] = dist;" below the adjacency matrix section
